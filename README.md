## About

This codebase is maintained by Vasha DuTell, a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Bruno Olshausen's lab. Analyzing natural movies has been a large part of my PhD work, so I put this package together to keep usefull code for running this type of analysis organized and in once place, and hoping it can be usefull to other people.
